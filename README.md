# Matchbox

## ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️

This will soon be the release version of matchbox, a versatile read processing tool for sequencing data. 

Currently you'll have a (slightly!) more stable experience with the original prototype version, [matchbox-alpha](https://github.com/jakob-schuster/matchbox-alpha).

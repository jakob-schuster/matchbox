# Matchbox

## ⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️

This will soon be the release version of matchbox, a versatile read processing tool for sequencing data.

Currently you'll have a (slightly!) more stable experience with the original prototype version, [matchbox-alpha](https://github.com/jakob-schuster/matchbox-alpha).

## Todo before this becomes main matchbox

- [ ] fix memory leak
- [x] fix script parsing statements after conditionals
- [ ] make terms effectful
- [ ] add optional arguments
